# MyStat Housing

This project is a custom 3D printed housing for the open-source MyStat potentiostat, designed for use in experimental flow battery setups as part of the FAIR Battery / [Flow Battery Research Collective](https://fbrc.dev/). The housing provides a compact, durable, and functional enclosure for the circuit board, protecting it from spills and wear during lab work.

## Design Overview

The MyStat is an open-source potentiostat used in electrochemical experiments, including testing and development of low-cost flow batteries. The bare circuit board is not well-suited to use in wet or rugged lab environments, so this project provides a simple, protective enclosure that balances usability, airflow, and aesthetics.

## Design Considerations

- **Access and Serviceability**: The housing needed to be easy to open and close to allow insertion and removal of the board, while keeping all components securely in place.
- **Thermal Management**: To prevent overheating during use, the housing includes passive airflow vents and an active cooling fan, mounted on the rear panel.
- **Fan Integration**: The fan is powered directly from the MyStat board, requiring no additional power source. It pulls air across the internal components through a honeycomb-pattern front vent.
- **Ergonomics and Aesthetics**: The body features a smooth, ovate design for pleasant handling and a clean appearance. The logo of the Flow Battery Research Collective is debossed into the top.
- **Assembly**: The body includes embedded nut slots for clean panel mounting using screws, making it easy to disassemble without damage.
