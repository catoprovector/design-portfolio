# Filament Drying Drawer

This is a custom-built filament drying drawer designed for the prototyping lab at Utrecht University. The drawer replaces a standard cabinet drawer and is built entirely from clear plexiglass. It allows upright storage of multiple 3D printing filament reels in a low-humidity environment, improving print quality and material longevity.

## Design Overview

The drawer is designed to fit into the lab’s existing cabinetry and provide a transparent, enclosed environment for filament storage. The spools are stored upright for easy access and visibility. The lid opens from the top via a piano hinge along the back edge, allowing full access without removing the drawer.

## Construction and Materials

- **Frame**: All panels are laser-cut or hand-cut from clear plexiglass and bonded using solvent adhesives for strength and an airtight seal.
- **Hinge Mechanism**: A piano hinge runs along the back top edge, allowing the lid to lift open.
- **Airflow**: Tubing is routed into the enclosure to allow bursts of dried air to flow through.
- **Sensors and Control**: A humidity sensor triggers the airflow system when the internal humidity rises above a set threshold. A magnetic latch sensor disables airflow when the lid is open, conserving dry air and preventing waste.

## Design Process

The drawer was first modeled in Fusion 360, and technical drawings were created for fabrication. Plexiglass pieces were cut using a combination of laser cutting and hand tools, then bonded with a solvent adhesive. Tubing, sensors, and wiring were added after the enclosure was assembled.
