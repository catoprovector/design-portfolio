# Shelf Foot

A simple printed standoff to level a metal shelf on uneven flooring. I designed this to support the front legs of a shelf where the back legs rested on a raised lip, allowing the whole shelf to stand level and stable.

## Design and Construction

The design needed to:
- Support the weight of a loaded metal shelf.
- Fit snugly onto the triangular front legs.
- Look clean and simple.

They were printed in PLA with 15% infill for a good balance of strength and print time. No post-processing was needed after printing.
