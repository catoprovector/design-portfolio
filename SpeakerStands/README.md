# Speaker Stands

Custom stands built to elevate a pair of speakers and allow clearance for cable connections underneath. The speakers had connectors on their bottom side, so they could not sit flat on a surface. These stands provide stable support while keeping a minimal and clean look.

## Design and Construction

The stands consist of:
- Four 3D-printed corner feet made in silver PLA.
- Thin extruded aluminum L-profile bars connecting the feet.
- Small nuts and bolts securing everything together.

The design goals were simplicity, functionality, and elegance. The printed feet hold the aluminum pieces in place securely and distribute the weight of the speaker evenly. Assembly was quick and modular, with no adhesives or post-processing required.
