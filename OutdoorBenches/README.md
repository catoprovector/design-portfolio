# Outdoor Benches

This project began during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to stay creative and hands-on. I designed and built a set of wooden benches from scratch, and then painted them with a detailed, layered process.

The painting involved priming the wood, adding a solid gray base layer, and then applying multiple colors one by oneâ€”each separated by extensive masking with painter's tape. The final result reflects my strong eye for design, pattern, and attention to detail.
