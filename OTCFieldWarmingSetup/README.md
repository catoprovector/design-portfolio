# OTC Field Warming Setup

This project was part of my master's thesis, focused on designing and building a field-based experimental setup to simulate future climate warming for plant studies. The system uses heated Open Top Containers (OTCs) to raise temperatures by 2–3 °C above ambient conditions, allowing researchers to observe ecological responses.

## Project Summary

Each OTC is composed of six trapezoidal plexiglass panels connected using bent stainless steel sheet metal brackets. The brackets are forked and angled at the bottom to anchor the structure securely into the ground. A custom jig and router were used to cut each panel to the correct angles, and the final assembly was bolted together on-site.

## Electronics and Sensors

To monitor and control the temperature inside the OTCs, I built custom temperature logging units using Arduino boards and thermocouples, significantly reducing costs compared to commercial solutions. Heating cables were controlled using MOSFETs and additional microcontrollers.

All electronics were housed in a custom-built wooden box elevated on small legs to protect from moisture. Several custom 3D-printed parts were included in the electronics housing: brackets, component mounts, and wire-to-wire connectors designed for joining delicate heating wire to standard power cables. These connectors were sealed with epoxy for field durability.

## Design Considerations

- Designed for durability, weatherproofing, and modular repair.
- Focused on cost-effectiveness by replacing commercial hardware with DIY alternatives.
- Integrated structural and electronics components for an all-in-one field-ready solution.
